# Inspiration
Sometimes it's hard to sit in front of a screen all day and write code. It definitely takes a **toll on your health**. So why not go *old-school* and write the code on a pen and paper so that it doesn't affect your Health.


# What it does
**Codifier** is a web based code converter which can translate your *handwritten code* into *actual typed code* in just a few seconds. Don't worry about typing all the code, just scan and upload and *Et-voil√†!* It also Compiles the code in various languages like **C,C++,Java,Python**.


#  How we built it
* React Js: For the frontend
* TypeScript: Frontend using React Typescript
* Firebase: For user authentication and database
* Tailwind CSS: For styling
* Figma: For Designing


# AI Code Recognition Challenges
Codifier uses Google API for recognizing the handritten text and converting into typed code, It also uses the Paiza API to compile the code into different languages.


# Use of Google API
* 
* 

# Challenges We ran into
The Biggest Challenge we ran into was to configure the API to recognize and convert the code.


# What we learnt
Working with React Js and Figma.


# What's Next for Codifier
