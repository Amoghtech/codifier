## üí°Inspiration
Sometimes it's hard to sit in front of a screen all day and write code. It definitely takes a **toll on your health**. So why not go *old-school* and write the code on a pen and paper so that it doesn't affect your Health.

Also this can be helpful for the students who are getting on with coding and have *lack of resources* (like laptops). So they have to use their mobile phone to write and compile their code **which takes a lot of time and effort**.


## üíªWhat it does
**Codifier** is a web based code converter which can translate your *handwritten code* into *actual typed code* using **OCR** in just a few seconds. Don't worry about typing all the code, just scan and upload and *Et-voil√†!* It also Compiles the code in various languages like **C,C++,Java,Python**.

## üî∑Steps to Use
1. Click on get Started.
1. Select the option to either click a photo or choose from gallery.
1. Upload your Scanned code and click on **Convert**.
    * This process will take you to the compiler.
1. Select your programming language.
1. After getting your code on the screen, you can edit the code if you want.
1. Click the Compile button to compile and run it into the output screen.


## üî®How we built it
* React Js: For Frontend
* Tailwind CSS: For styling
* Figma: For Designing. (You can see it [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/geIJeadw8u9XAQ4BrdAMp2/Pictocode?node-id=2%3A2&starting-point-node-id=2%3A2))
* Node Js: For Backend Server
* API Google Cloud Vision and [JDoodle API](https://docs.jdoodle.com/compiler-api/compiler-api)

## üíªAI Code Recognition Challenges
Codifier uses Google Cloud Vision API for recognizing the handritten code and converting into typed code, It also uses the JDoodle API to compile and run the code into different programming languages like **C,C++,Java,Python**.


## üß†Use of Google Cloud Vision API
* Handritten code Recognition.
* Conversion into Type code.

## üèÖChallenges We ran into
* Communication gap due to Online Hackathons.
* The Biggest Challenge we ran into was, to configure the API to recognize and convert the code.
* Compiling and running the code into different languages.

## üìñWhat we learnt
1. Team Building
1. Working with:
* React Js
* Figma
* Multer
* Git and Github
* APIs
* PWA (Progressive Web Applications)
